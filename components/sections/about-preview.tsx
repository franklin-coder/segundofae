                Welcome to FaeLight Crafts, where every piece tells a story of passion, 
                creativity, and craftsmanship. Based in beautiful Victoria, Canada, 
                I'm Julia, and I create handmade macram√© jewelry that celebrates 
                the beauty of natural materials and traditional techniques.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                My journey began with a simple love for creating beautiful things with my hands. 
                Today, each piece represents hours of careful work, using time-honored 
                techniques and focusing on quality craftsmanship.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                At FaeLight Crafts, we believe jewelry should be more than just an accessory - 
                it should be a reflection of your unique style and personality. Each piece 
                is thoughtfully designed and carefully crafted to bring beauty and meaning 
                to your everyday life.
